    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
        Hi there! Sriyam here! I'm a computer science major, currently in the middle of my 3rd semester. I'm learning all the computer stuff that you expect from a 3rd sem pupil. I'm proficient in C++, C and C#, as I create games using these languages often. Apart from the C family, I am familiar with Java and Python in a sense that I can easily code without having to search for a grip.
